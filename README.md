# Astronomy Exploration in Python and Go

This repository explores my personal interest in astronomy using Python and Go. It covers a range of topics, from orbital mechanics to the dynamics of galaxies, through both mathematical models and visual simulations. By leveraging Python’s rich scientific libraries and Go’s performance-oriented structure, this repository demonstrates how coding can deepen our understanding of the cosmos.

Key themes include the modeling and visualization of **planetary orbits**, the mapping of **constellations**, and **galactic dynamics** simulations. You will also find explorations of **stellar evolution**, **black holes**, and **exoplanet detection techniques**. Each project is designed to combine fundamental astronomy principles with code implementations to offer a practical and engaging way to study the universe.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute to this ongoing journey into the stars. Whether you’re here for the physics or the programming, this repository offers insights into both disciplines.

### Explanation of the Directory:

- **`python/`**: Contains all Python projects related to astronomy topics.
  - **`orbits/`**: Focuses on planetary orbit simulations and visualizations.
  - **`constellations/`**: Contains scripts to map and visualize constellations.
  - **`galaxies/`**: Explores galactic dynamics and stellar orbits within galaxies.
  - **`exoplanets/`**: Covers simulations for exoplanet detection techniques.
  
- **`go/`**: Directory for Go projects that mirror Python projects but with Go's efficient handling.
  - Each subdirectory (orbits, constellations, galaxies) holds the Go implementations for those projects.

- **`data/`**: Shared data files that are used across both Python and Go projects, including stellar evolution, black hole properties, and exoplanet data.

- **`docs/`**: Documentation such as setup guides and overviews of the astronomy topics covered in the repository.
